# react-tic-tac-toe-tutorial

# About
This project is based on the official [React tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) to create a Tic Tac Toe game. You can learn how to build a React app from scratch by following the steps in the tutorial.

## Getting Started
To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository using `git clone`.
2. Navigate to the project directory using `cd react-tic-tac-toe-tutorial`.
3. Install the project dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Start the development server using `npm start`.
5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the game in action.

## How to Play
The game is a simple Tic Tac Toe game. It consists of a 3x3 grid where two players take turns marking their respective symbols (X or O) on the grid. The first player to get three symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. The game continues until all squares on the grid are marked, at which point the game is a draw.

Enjoy!
